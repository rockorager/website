title: Prebuilt Ghostty Binaries and Packages
description: |-
  Install Ghostty without building it manually by downloading
  and running a prebuilt binary or package.
---

The Ghostty project only officially provides prebuilt binaries
for macOS. Other platforms may provide packages for Ghostty,
but those packages are maintained by the community. This page will
list both official and community-provided binary packages.

<Note>
  At the time of writing, Ghostty has only recently been publicly released. As a
  result, the number of community-provided binary packages is zero. This page
  will be updated as community-provided packages become available.
</Note>

## macOS

Official macOS binaries are provided by the Ghostty project and
are available on the [download page](/download).

These binaries are signed and notarized by the Ghostty project.
To install, download the `.dmg` file, open it, and drag the
Ghostty application to your Applications folder. This is the same
process as installing many typical macOS applications.

**Where is Homebrew?** The Ghostty project does not maintain a Homebrew
formula or tap. We rely on the community to provide alternate packaging
methods similar to Linux. At the time of writing, Ghostty is too new
for community-provided packages to be available. If and when they
become available, this page will be updated.

## Linux

Pre-built Linux binaries or packages are provided by the community.
At the time of writing, no community-provided packages are available
because Ghostty has only recently been publicly released. This page
will be updated as community-provided packages become available.

If your platform isn't available, you must
[build Ghostty from source](/docs/install/build).

<Tip>
  **Interested in creating a package for your platform?** Check out the
  [packaging
  guide](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/blob/main/PACKAGING.md). If you
  need any help, feel free to make an issue. Once your package is ready, submit
  a pull request to add it to this page!

### Nix Flake

There is Nix package that can be used in the
[Ghostty flake](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/blob/main/flake.nix)
(`packages.ghostty` or `packages.default`). This is a good way
to track specific commits of Ghostty.

While the Ghostty project does not maintain any official packages for
Linux, Ghostty maintains an in-repo Nix flake because Nix is used as
our primary development and CI environment. The Ghostty project does
not maintain any official NixOS packages (in `nixpkgs`).

Below is an example:

```nix
{
  inputs = {
    nixpkgs.url = "github:NixOS/nixpkgs/nixos-unstable";

    ghostty = {
      url = "github:ghostty-org/ghostty";
    };
  };

  outputs = { nixpkgs, ghostty, ... }: {
    nixosConfigurations.mysystem = nixpkgs.lib.nixosSystem {
      modules = [
        {
          environment.systemPackages = [
            ghostty.packages.x86_64-linux.default
          ];
        }
      ];
    };
  };
}
```

### Arch Linux

The recommended way to install Ghostty is to install one of the existing AUR
packages. Currently there are two packages being maintained, one that builds
against stable tags, and one that builds against the `main` branch. It is
recommended to use the former as it is less likely to have bugs and provide
stability.

- The [ghostty](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/ghostty) package is built agaist
  stable releases and is the **recommended** package to install.
- The [ghostty-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/ghostty-git) package is built
  against the `main` git branch and **may be unstable** at times.

Below is an example of how to install one of the packages using the
[yay](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/yay) AUR helper:

```sh
# Install Ghostty stable
yay -S ghostty

# Install Ghostty nightly
yay -S ghostty-git
```

If neither option works, then you can [build from source](/docs/install/build)
instead of using either of the packages.

---

macOS tiling window managers such as Yabai or Aerospace may
render Ghostty tabs as separate windows. This is a known issue
that is well documented in both the Yabai and Aerospace
issue trackers.

Ghostty uses macOS native tabs. macOS native tabs are represented
as separate windows in the macOS window manager API. This is
the API that Yabai, Aerospace, and other tiling window managers
use to manage windows on macOS.

As such, this is a limitation of macOS APIs and there isn't
anything Ghostty can do to fix this issue.

<Note>
Longer term, we'd like to implement a custom tabbing solution
that doesn't rely on macOS native tabs. This would allow us
to better integrate with macOS tiling window managers.

## Workarounds

The Ghostty community has identified potential workarounds
depending on the tiling window manager you are using.

### Aerospace

```toml
[[on-window-detected]]
if.app-id="com.mitchellh.ghostty"
run= [
  "layout floating",
]
```

### Yabai

```
yabai -m signal --add app='^Ghostty$' event=window_created action='yabai -m space --layout bsp'
yabai -m signal --add app='^Ghostty$' event=window_destroyed action='yabai -m space --layout bsp'
```

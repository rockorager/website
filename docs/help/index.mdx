Ghostty is a personal side project with no commercial backing.
As such, there is no support team or dedicated resources to help you.
The community is very helpful and may provide assistance, and
we try to document as many common issues and solutions as possible.

## Common Issues and Solutions

| Issue | Solution |

## Reporting Bugs or Requesting Features

Please, please, please read the [contributing guide on GitHub](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

<Important>
**GitHub Issues is probably not the right place to go.** This project
starts all bugs and feature requests as discussions on GitHub Discussions
until more specific details are known. From there, we convert them into
GitHub Issues as needed. See the contributing guide for more details.

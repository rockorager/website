[Terminfo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminfo) is an archaic format
still in use by many terminal applications to determine the capabilities
of the terminal. Ghostty ships with its own terminfo entry to advertise
its features.

Ghostty uses the `TERM` value of `xterm-ghostty`.

<Note>
**Why the `xterm` prefix?** Unfortunately, many terminal applications
string search for "xterm" in the `TERM` value to _assume capabilities_.
During the private beta, we experimented with a pure `ghostty` value, but
found that too many applications broke and fixing the entire ecosystem
was unrealistic. We settled on `xterm-ghostty` to maintain compatibility.
</Note>

Ghostty packages include the terminfo entry and set the proper filesystem
layouts or environment variables to make it available to the system.
When you run Ghostty, it will automatically set the `TERM` environment
variable to `xterm-ghostty` so long as it detects that the terminfo entry
is available.

## Sudo

If you use `sudo`, sudo may reset your environment variables and you may see
an error about `missing or unsuitable terminal: xterm-ghostty` when running
some programs.

To resolve this, you must either configure sudo to preserve
the `TERMINFO` environment variable, or you can use shell-integration with
the `sudo` feature enabled and Ghostty will alias sudo to automatically do
this for you. To enable the shell-integration feature specify
`shell-integration-features = sudo` in your configuration.

## SSH

If you use SSH to connect to other machines that do not have Ghostty's
terminfo entry, you will see error messages like `missing or unsuitable
terminal: xterm-ghostty`.

Hopefully someday Ghostty will have terminfo entries pre-distributed
everywhere, but in the meantime there are two ways to resolve the situation:

1.  Copy Ghostty's terminfo entry to the remote machine.
2.  Configure SSH to fall back to a known terminfo entry.

### Copy Ghostty's terminfo to a remote machine

The following one-liner will export the terminfo entry from your host and
import it on the remote machine:

```sh
infocmp -x | ssh YOUR-SERVER -- tic -x -
```

The `tic` command on the server may give the warning `"<stdin>", line 2,
col 31, terminal 'xterm-ghostty': older tic versions may treat the description
field as an alias` which can be safely ignored.

<Note>
**macOS versions before Sonoma cannot use the system-bundled `infocmp`.**
The bundled version of `ncurses` is too old to emit a terminfo entry that can be
read by more recent versions of `tic`, and the command will fail with a bunch
of `Illegal character` messages. You can fix this by using Homebrew to install
a recent version of `ncurses` and replacing `infocmp` above with the full path
`/opt/homebrew/opt/ncurses/bin/infocmp`.
</Note>

### Configure SSH to fall back to a known terminfo entry

If copying around terminfo entries is untenable, you can override `TERM` to a
fallback value using SSH config.

```ssh-config
# .ssh/config
Host example.com
  SetEnv TERM=xterm-256color
```

**Requires OpenSSH 8.7 or newer.** [The 8.7 release added
support](https://www.openssh.com/txt/release-8.7) for setting `TERM` via
`SetEnv`.

<Warning>
**Fallback does not support advanced terminal features.** Because
`xterm-256color` does not include all of Ghostty's capabilities, terminal
features beyond xterm's like colored and styled underlines will not work.
</Warning>

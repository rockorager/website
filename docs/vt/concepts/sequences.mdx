title: Control Sequences
description: |-
  Control sequences are a way for programs to interact with the terminal.
---

Control sequences are used to do things like move the cursor, change
text color, clear the screen, and more. They are the primary way
that programs interact with the terminal.

Programs running within terminals only have a single way to communicate
with the terminal: writing bytes to the connected file descriptor
(typically a pty). In order to differentiate between text to be
displayed and commands to be executed, terminals use special syntax
known collectively as **control sequences**.

Due to the historical nature of terminals, control sequences come
in a handful of different formats. Most begin with an escape character
(`0x1B`), so control sequences are sometimes referred to as
**escape codes** or **escape sequences**.

There are eight types of control sequences:

- Control Characters
- Escape Sequences
- CSI Sequences ("Control Sequence Introducer")
- OSC Sequences ("Operating System Command")
- DCS Sequences ("Device Control Sequence")
- SOS Sequences ("Start Of String")
- PM Sequences ("Privacy Message")
- APC Sequences ("Application Program Command")

Each type of control sequence has a different format and purpose.
They are described below along with their specific syntax. The
[reference](/docs/vt/reference) contains a full list of supported
control sequences grouped by type.

## Control Characters

Control characters are single byte characters that have a special
meaning. They have no encoding format; you send the bytes as-is.
For example, [backspace](/docs/vt/control/bs) is `0x08`,
[linefeed](/docs/vt/control/lf) is `0x0A`, etc.

There are very few control characters, but they're important
to be aware of because the single byte value impacts the terminal
state.

## Escape Sequences

Escape sequences are in the format below. An example escape sequence
is `ESC D`.

```
esc_sequence = "0x1B" intermediates final
intermediates = [0x20-0x2F]*
final = [0x30-0x7E]
```

## CSI Sequences

CSI sequences are in the format below. An example CSI sequence
is `ESC [ 1 ; 2 m`. CSI sequences are only capable of encoding integer values.

```
csi_sequence = "0x1B" "[" params intermediates final
params = param | param sep params
param = [0-9]
sep = ";" | ":"
intermediates = [0x20-0x2F]*
final = [0x40-0x7E]
```

## OSC Sequences

OSC Sequences are typically used to encode strings or other non-integer data to
transmit between the terminal and the application. The format of an OSC sequence
is below. An example OSC sequence is `OSC 2 ; ðŸ‘»  Ghostty ðŸ‘»  ST` (where `ST` is
the String Terminator). By convention, OSC sequences *usually* have some integer
identifier to identify the sequence.

```
osc_sequence = "0x1B" "]" data ST
data = [0x20-0xFF]
ST = "0x1B" "0x5C"
```

## DCS Sequences

DCS Sequences are like a CSI sequence combined with an OSC sequence: they
natively support integer parameters as well as string values. An example DSC
sequence is `DCS + P q <string> ST`

```
dsc_sequence = "0x1B" "P" params intermediates final data ST
params = param | param ";" params
param = [0-9]
intermediates = [0x20-0x2F]*
final = [0x40-0x7E]
data = [0x20-0xFF]
ST = "0x1B" "0x5C"
```

## APC Sequences

Ghostty supports APC sequences. Currently there is only one supported APC
sequence: the Kitty Graphics Protocol sequence. This is documented [here]
(https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/graphics-protocol/).

```
apc_sequence = "0x1B" "_" data ST
data = [0x20-0xFF]
ST = "0x1B" "0x5C"
```

## SOS and PM Sequences

SOS and PM sequences are entirely ignored by Ghostty.

```
sos_sequence = "0x1B" "X" data ST
pm_sequence = "0x1B" "^" data ST
data = [0x20-0xFF]
ST = "0x1B" "0x5C"
```

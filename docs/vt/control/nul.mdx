<VTSequence sequence="BEL" unimplemented />

The purpose of the bell sequence is to raise the attention
of the user.

Historically, this would
[ring a physical bell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_character).
Today, many alternate behaviors are acceptable:

- An audible sound can be played through the speakers
- Background or border of a window can visually flash
- The terminal window can come into focus or be put on top
- Application icon can bounce or otherwise draw attention
- A desktop notification can be shown

Normally, the bell behavior is configurable and can be disabled.

## BEL as an OSC Terminator

The `BEL` character is also a valid terminating character for
OSC sequences, although `ST` is preferred. If `BEL` is the
terminating character for an OSC sequence, any responses should
also terminate with the `BEL` character.[^1]

## Ghostty Status

This control character is not currently implemented in Ghostty,
but can be used as an OSC terminator. If it is used as an OSC
terminator, Ghostty will terminate any responses with the
`BEL` character.

There is an [open discussion](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/discussions/2710)
about implementing the bell character in Ghostty and what
that will look like.

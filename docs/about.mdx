title: About Ghostty

Ghostty is a terminal emulator that differentiates itself by being
fast, feature-rich, and native. While there are many excellent terminal
emulators available, they all force you to choose between speed,
features, or native UIs. Ghostty provides all three.

In all categories, I am not trying to claim that Ghostty is the
best (i.e. the fastest, most feature-rich, or most native). But
when I set out to create Ghostty, I felt all terminals made
you choose at most two of these categories. I wanted to create
a terminal that was competitive in all three categories and I
believe Ghostty achieves that goal.

Before diving into the details, I also want to note that Ghostty
is a passion project started by [Mitchell Hashimoto](https://mitchellh.com)
(that's me!). It's something I work on in my free time and is a
labor of love. Please don't forget this when interacting with
the project. I'm doing my best to make something great along with
the lovely contributors, but it's not a full-time job for any of us.

## Native

The big picture of "native" is that Ghostty is designed to look,
feel, and behave like you expect an application to behave in your
desktop environment.

Importantly, Ghostty _is_ a native application for macOS and Linux.
On macOS, the GUI is written in Swift and uses AppKit and SwiftUI.
On Linux, the GUI is written in Zig and uses the GTK4 C API[^1].
The GUIs interface with a shared core written in Zig that we
call "libghostty". For those unfamiliar with Zig, it is a
systems programming language that compiles to native machine code.

Part of this is using native UI components for features like tabs,
splits, error messages, etc. in contrast to many other terminal
emulators that either use text UIs and custom widgets or
don't support these features at all.

Another part is using standard keyboard and mouse shortcuts
that you're already familiar with. Ghostty uses different default
bindings on macOS and Linux to match the conventions of each
platform.

And a third part is Ghostty integrates with system capabilities
that are unique to the platform it is running on. For example,
on macOS, Ghostty supports Quick Look, force touch, the macOS
secure input API, built-in window state recovery on restart,
etc. These are all native APIs provided by macOS that don't have
equivalents in Linux desktop environments.

## Feature-rich

Ghostty tries to provide a rich set of features that are useful
for everydays use. These can be split into two categories:
terminal features and application features.

Terminal features include the capabilities that programs running
inside the terminal can use. For example, Ghostty supports
the Kitty graphics protocol, light/dark mode notifications,
hyperlinks, and more.
This lets terminal applications like Neovim, Zellij, and
others do more than they could in other terminal emulators[^2].

Application features are higher-level features that are useful
for interacting with the terminal emulator itself. For example,
Ghostty supports native tabs, splits, a drop-down terminal
on macOS, theme switching on system dark/light mode, etc.

## Fast

Ghostty aims to be fast.

Performance is a category where people start getting really
argumentative, so the only claim I make is that Ghostty aims
to be in the same class as the fastest terminal emulators.
In some benchmarks it is faster, in others it is slower, but
in every case it should be impossible to say that Ghostty is
slow.

"Fast" is also a loaded term since "fast" can mean different
things to different people. For example, here is just a
small list of the things that can be "fast": startup time,
scrolling speed, IO throughput, control sequence throughput,
framerates, etc.

In the future, I'd like to provide detailed benchmarks and
explanations about how Ghostty performs in various performance
categories. For the initial public release, I'll just say that
Ghostty aims to be "fast" as described above.

I know many don't believe that speed is that important for a
terminal emulator, but new users to Ghostty repeatedly told me
that they were very surprised how noticeable the speed
improvements were to their everyday use. I hope you'll feel the
same way.

## libghostty

Ghostty also differentiates itself with its architecture. The
core of Ghostty is a cross-platform, C-ABI compatible library called
`libghostty`. `libghostty` provides the core terminal emulation, font handling,
and rendering capabilities.

The Ghostty GUI applications are consumers of `libghostty`. The macOS app is
written in Swift, uses AppKit and SwiftUI, and links against the `libghostty`
C API. The Linux app is written in Zig, uses the GTK4 C API, and also links
against `libghostty`[^3].

This architecture allows for a clean separation between the terminal
emulation and the GUI. It is the key architecture that allows Ghostty
to achieve its goal of being [native](#native).

This architecture makes Ghostty unique since Ghostty the project also aims
to enable other terminal emulator projects to be built on top of a shared
core. This allows for a more diverse ecosystem of terminal emulators that
can focus on higher-level features and UIs without needing to reimplement
the core terminal emulation.

<Note>
As of the initial public release, `libghostty` is not yet a stable API
and has not been released as a standalone, stable library. However, it is
already in use by the macOS and Linux GUI applications. The goal is to
stabilize the API and release it as a standalone library in the future.
</Note>

[^1]: Linux doesn't have a "native" GUI toolkit like macOS, but
GTK4 is the closest thing to a standard GUI toolkit that exists.
Most importantly, we don't draw custom widgets and Ghostty will
fit right into your desktop environment.

[^2]: For example, Neovim uses synchronized rendering to prevent
tearing between frames.

[^3]: Since the GTK4 app is written in Zig, it doesn't link in the traditional
sense. Instead, it uses the public `libghostty` APIs and compiles as a single
Zig compilation unit.
